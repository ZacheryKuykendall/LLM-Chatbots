# Chat with Hugging Face Models on Windows

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run a chat interface for interacting with Hugging Face models on a Windows machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your Windows machine.
- **Internet connection** for downloading models from Hugging Face.
- **Hugging Face account** (optional, but required for accessing certain models).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed, download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and follow the installation instructions.

- During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.

### 2. Clone or Download the Project

Create a directory for your project and navigate to it using Command Prompt or PowerShell.

```
mkdir chat_with_huggingface_models
cd chat_with_huggingface_models
```

Download the `chat_with_model.py` script and save it in this directory.

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment ensures that your project's dependencies are isolated from other Python projects.

```
python -m venv venv
```

This command creates a folder named `venv` containing the virtual environment.

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

- For **Command Prompt**:
    
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    
- For **PowerShell**:
    
    ```powershell
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
    
    > Note: If you encounter an execution policy error in PowerShell, run:
    > 
    
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
    

### 5. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
transformers
torch
python-dotenv
```

Install the dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Set Up the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in your project directory to store environment variables.

```
echo HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here > .env
```

Replace `your_huggingface_api_token_here` with your actual Hugging Face API token. If you don't have one, you can get it by:

1. Creating a Hugging Face account at huggingface.co.
2. Navigating to your API tokens page.
3. Generating a new token and copying it.

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```makefile
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token_here
```

> Security Tip: Do not share your .env file or commit it to version control systems like Git.
> 

## Running the Script

Ensure you're in your project directory and the virtual environment is activated.

Run the script using:

```
python chat_with_model.py
```

## Using the Chat Interface

1. **Enter Model Name or Path**: When prompted, input the name of the Hugging Face model you wish to use.
    - Examples:
        - For models hosted on Hugging Face Hub:
            - `gpt2`
            - `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M`
            - `facebook/opt-125m`
        - For local models (if you have any saved locally):
            - `./models/your_local_model`
2. **Start Chatting**: After the model loads (this may take a few moments, especially if it's downloading), you can begin the conversation.
    - Type your message after the `User:` prompt.
    - The model will respond after processing your input.
    - Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session.

## Example Session

```vbnet
Enter the Hugging Face model name or local path.
Examples: 'gpt2', 'EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M', './models/local_model'
Model name or path: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct

You can start chatting with the model. Type 'exit' to quit.

User: Hello!
Model: Hello! How can I assist you today?

User: What's the weather like today?
Model: I'm not sure about the weather today, but you might want to check a local forecast!

User: exit
Exiting chat.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Module Not Found Errors**
    - **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers'`
    - **Solution**: Ensure you've activated your virtual environment and installed dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Execution Policy Error in PowerShell**
    - **Error**: `Scripts cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`
    - **Solution**: In PowerShell, run:
        
        ```powershell
        Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
        ```
        
3. **Invalid Hugging Face Token**
    - **Error**: `401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url`
    - **Solution**: Check that your Hugging Face API token is correct in the `.env` file.
4. **Model Loading Errors**
    - **Error**: `Error loading model as AutoModelForCausalLM`
    - **Solution**: Ensure the model name is correct and that you have access to it. Some models require special permissions.
5. **Out of Memory Errors**
    - **Error**: `RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory.`
    - **Solution**: Try using a smaller model or run the script on CPU by setting the `device` to `'cpu'` in the script.

### Checking Python and Pip Versions

- Verify Python is installed correctly:
    
    ```
    python --version
    ```
    
- Verify `pip` is installed:
    
    ```
    pip --version
    ```
    

## Additional Notes

- **GPU Usage**: The script automatically uses GPU if available. Ensure you have the appropriate CUDA drivers installed if you're using a GPU.
- **Adjusting Model Parameters**: You can customize the model's response behavior by modifying parameters like `max_length`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `temperature` in the `chat_with_model.py` script.
- **Using Local Models**: If you have models saved locally, place them in a `models` directory within your project and provide the path when prompted.
